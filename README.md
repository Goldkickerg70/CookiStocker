CookiStocker 3.0 Ported to Github

Not gonna lie to you all, I used GPT to fix the code, as it was NOT functional in browser whatsoever (would freeze upon any sort of saving or loading without refreshing the browser). 
I have next to none coding experience so I don't know what it actually did.

THIS, is what I ended up with.
I have no intention of fixing anything broken unless I happen to come across it, I was simply just trying to get this ported and actually working for the most part without freezing my game.
Your guess at what GPT did is as good as mine.
