CookiStocker 3.0 Ported to Github

Not gonna lie to you all, I used GPT to fix the code, as it was NOT functional in browser whatsoever (would freeze upon any sort of saving or loading without refreshing the browser). 
I have next to none coding experience so I don't know what it actually did.

In the end it seemed like GPT was very upset trying to fix some sort of "Achievements" and compensating for it here and there in order to retain code, in the end I told it to remove any sort of thing mentioning achievements and to fix it where it thinks things needed to be fixed.
THIS, is what I ended up with.
I have no intention of fixing anything broken unless I happen to come across it, I was simply just trying to get this ported and actually working for the most part without freezing my game.
Your guess at what GPT did is as good as mine.
